# Managing Perses Resources with ConfigMaps

!!! note
    This approach is only applicable when Perses is configured to use file system storage (`config.database.file`).

A sidecar container is deployed in the Perses pod when enabled. This container uses [kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar](https://github.com/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar) to watch all ConfigMaps in the cluster and filters out the ones with a configurable label (default: `perses.dev/resource: "true"`). 

The files defined in those ConfigMaps are written by the sidecar to a shared volume that is also mounted by the main Perses container at the [provisioning path](https://perses.dev/perses/docs/configuration/provisioning). Changes to the ConfigMaps are continuously monitored by the sidecar and reflected in Perses based on the **provisioning configuration interval** (by default 10 minutes).

All Perses resources such as Dashboards, Projects, Datasources, etc. can be managed as ConfigMaps using this approach.

## How It Works

The ConfigMap-based resource management uses a combination of Kubernetes sidecar pattern and Perses provisioning:

1. **ConfigMaps** → Created with configurable label (configured via `sidecar.label` and `sidecar.labelValue`)
2. **Sidecar Container** → Watches and extracts ConfigMap contents to filesystem
3. **Shared Volume** → Sidecar writes ConfigMap contents to a shared volume mounted by both containers
4. **Perses Provisioning** → Scans the shared volume at configured interval and loads resources into perses file-based database

## Configuration

### Sidecar Configuration

Enable the sidecar in your Helm values:

```yaml
sidecar:
  enabled: true
  label: "perses.dev/resource"
  labelValue: "true"
  allNamespaces: true  # Watch ConfigMaps from all namespaces
```

### Provisioning Timing

The frequency of resource updates is controlled by Perses provisioning configuration, not the sidecar. To configure faster updates, adjust the provisioning interval in your Perses configuration:

```yaml
provisioning:
  interval: "5m"  # Check for changes every 5 minutes instead of default 10 minutes
  folders:
    - /etc/perses/provisioning  # Path where the shared volume is mounted
```

## Easy ConfigMap Creation with Helm template

You can manage multiple Perses resources by placing the Perses resource files under a `files/` directory in your chart and letting a Helm template turn them into labeled ConfigMaps automatically.

First, organize your chart like this (one JSON file per resource is recommended):

```bash
your-chart/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── templates/
│   └── configmap-generator.yaml   # The Helm template shown below
└── files/
    ├── dashboards/
    │   └── dashboard1.json
    ├── datasources/
    │   └── prometheus.json
    └── projects/
        └── project1.json
```

Then add the following Helm template at `templates/configmap-generator.yaml` to render one ConfigMap per JSON resource. The file's basename becomes the key inside the ConfigMap, and the required sidecar label is applied automatically. This keeps each resource isolated and avoids the 1MB ConfigMap size limit.

```yaml
# templates/configmap-generator.yaml
{{- range $path, $bytes := .Files.Glob "files/**/*.json" }}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ printf "%s-%s" $.Release.Name ($path | replace "/" "-" | replace ".json" "") | trunc 63 }}
  labels:
    {{ $.Values.perses.sidecar.label | default "perses.dev/resource" }}: "{{ $.Values.perses.sidecar.labelValue | default "true" }}"
data:
{{ printf "%s: |-" ($path | base) | indent 2 }}
{{ printf "%s" $bytes | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
```

In the above example, Helm will iterate over every `*.json` file under `files/` (recursively) and create a separate ConfigMap manifest for each.

## Examples

Below are examples of ConfigMaps for different Perses resources.

### Dashboard ConfigMap

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-dashboard
  labels:
    perses.dev/resource: "true"  # Use your configured sidecar.label and sidecar.labelValue
data:
  dashboard.json: |-
    {
      "kind": "Dashboard",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "my-dashboard",
        "project": "default"
      },
      "spec": {
        "display": {
          "name": "My Dashboard"
        },
        "panels": {
          "panel1": {
            "kind": "Panel",
            "spec": {
              "display": {
                "name": "Sample Panel"
              },
              "plugin": {
                "kind": "TimeSeriesChart",
                "spec": {}
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

### Project ConfigMap

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-project
  labels:
    perses.dev/resource: "true"  # Use your configured sidecar.label and sidecar.labelValue
data:
  project.json: |-
    {
      "kind": "Project",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "my-project"
      },
      "spec": {
        "display": {
          "name": "My Project"
        }
      }
    }
```

## Best Practices

ConfigMaps have a 1MB data limit in Kubernetes. It's recommended to use one resource per ConfigMap to avoid hitting this limit and to make resource management easier.
